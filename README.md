## 🌟 Why LINDA?
Traditional web browsing is outdated:  
❌ **Search engines overload you with links.**  
❌ **Too many tabs = distraction & inefficiency.**  
❌ **Most browsers track you & invade privacy.**  
✅ **LINDA is different:** it’s an **AI-powered web agent**, not just a browser.  

**With LINDA, you don’t search the web—you tell it what you need, and it does it for you.**
